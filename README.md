Hello, I am Ananda Poudel.
I am a Data Scientist and I love combining Data Analytics with soccer. I work mainly with R and Rshiny but also have knowledge in Python as well. 

Some of the stuff that I am currently working with on my dashboard include the following:
* Data Visualization
* Regression
* Bayesian Modeling
* Statistical Testing

Link to my dashboard: [Premier League](https://poudelap.shinyapps.io/PlDashboard/ "Premier League Dashboard")

I am also trying to utilize NLP for users to navigate easily using the dashboard.
One of the projects that I have worked on regarding NLP is topic modeling by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation which can be found [here](https://github.com/poudelananda/Topic-Modeling-NLP)
