# Hi there, I'm Ananda Poudel.
I'm a data scientist and a sports analytst enthusiast. I mainly write code with Python and R in my github.

Here are some of the stuff I enjoy doing:

  * Learning and applying new Machine learning concepts
  * Logistic Regression and Statistical analysis in Sports.
  * Improving visualization using RShiny for my premier league dashboard.
