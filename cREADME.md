Hello, I am Ananda Poudel.
I am a Data Scientist and I love combining Data Analytics with soccer. I work mainly with R and Rshiny but also have knowledge in Python as well. 

Some of the stuff that I am currently working with on my dashboard include the following:
* Data Visualization
* Regression
* Bayesian Modeling
* Statistical Testing
